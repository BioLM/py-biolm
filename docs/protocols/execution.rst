Execution
=========

Tasks run in order. Use **depends_on** to make a task wait for another task (or tasks) to complete. Use **skip_if**, **skip_if_empty**, and **foreach** for conditional or repeated execution. See :doc:`tasks` for task definitions and the full schema in ``schema/protocol_schema.json``.
