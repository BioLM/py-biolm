Working with models in the SDK.

The BioLM Python SDK provides several ways to interact with models:

- **Convenience function** ``biolm()`` - Quick one-liner calls
- **Model class** - Object-oriented interface for repeated operations
- **Low-level clients** - ``BioLMApi`` and ``BioLMApiClient`` for advanced use cases

All methods support batching, error handling, and various output formats.
